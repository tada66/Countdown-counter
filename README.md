# Countdown-counter
This simple app allows you to make simple countdown timers in OBS 
thanks to OBS' ability to read text from a file.

You just add for how many minutes and second you want your timer to run for
and hit the "Start Countdown" button. You can add a text before and after
the live countdown. You can also edit this text even after hitting the start button.

This app will generate 2 text files settings.xml and countdown.txt 
it will also download 4 sound effects. All of these files will be put into a file
called Counter, which will be put in the same destination as is the counter.exe program.
